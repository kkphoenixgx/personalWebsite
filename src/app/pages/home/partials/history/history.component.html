      <p #pFadeInY ><strong>Passion for Astronomy and Journey to Software Development</strong>: During my school years, I was deeply passionate about astronomy. I was captivated by the beauty of nebulas, the scientific discoveries, and the relentless pursuit of understanding the universe. However, my journey took an unexpected turn when I discovered coding as a hobby and began learning programming independently.</p>
      <p #pFadeInY >With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, my country implemented strict lockdowns, which disrupted my access to proper education in physics and other disciplines. This period of isolation gave me time to reflect on my future. Leveraging my self-taught skills, I delved deeper into software development and began envisioning a career in software architecture. I committed myself to rigorous study, day and night, to pave my path toward higher education.</p>

      <p><strong>Discovering My True Passion</strong>: Through this journey, I found my true calling. Coding combines pure logic with intellectual creativity ‚Äî two elements I deeply value. It offers a perfect blend of problem-solving, innovative thinking, and the opportunity to deliver impactful solutions to clients. Moreover, I developed a passion for business-driven technology, where creativity meets practicality to achieve meaningful outcomes.</p>

      <p #pFadeInX ><strong>In collage</strong>I am currently graduating in the best federal System Information course of Brasil. And why system of information? I think that I will handle more results understanding business logic of your company and developing results then understanding hardware and a lot of mathematics as Computer Cience and others, I really prefer a pratical approach, not a theorical one, however, I really love logic and math, sure it is important.</p>
      <p #pFadeInX >In my collage, I am currently working in my TCC that will Facilitate the development of embedded AI systems by creating a 3D simulated space of agents with embedded artificial intelligence</p>
